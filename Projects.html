            Mini Project</h3>
            <p id="p5">In my web development course, I undertook a mini project to create a study material website. This website, still in the developmental phase, serves as a repository for coding language books, PDFs, and video lectures. Representing my maiden web development endeavor, it showcases my initial foray into website creation. The platform is designed to provide a comprehensive resource hub for fellow learners, encapsulating a diverse range of educational materials. As we continue to refine and expand its features, this project has been an invaluable learning experience in the realm of web development.</p>

            Mini Project</h3>
            <p id="p5">Engaging in a Data Analysis Project (DAP) course, I delved into the analysis of India's top unicorns in 2023. This experience not only honed my analytical skills but also provided valuable insights into the dynamics of the business landscape. Inspired by this project, I am now eager to explore diverse fields through data analysis, recognizing its potential to uncover trends, inform decision-making, and drive innovation across various industries. The application of data-driven insights has sparked my interest in navigating the intersection of technology, business, and data analytics for future explorations.</p>
